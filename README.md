## **Technical Specifications**  

### **1. Core Technologies**  

#### **Frontend Stack**  
- **HTML5** – Semantic markup with structured sections (`<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`) for SEO and accessibility.  
- **CSS3** – Modular SCSS architecture with BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology for scalable styling.  
  - Custom animations using `@keyframes` and CSS transitions.  
  - Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive layouts.  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Vanilla JS for DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content loading.  
  - Intersection Observer API for scroll-triggered animations.  
  - Dynamic project filtering (if applicable).  

#### **Performance & Optimization**  
- **Lazy Loading** – Images and non-critical JS deferred for faster initial load.  
- **Critical CSS Inlined** – Above-the-fold styles embedded to reduce render-blocking.  
- **Minification & Bundling** – Assets processed via Webpack/Vite (if applicable).  
- **Preload & Prefetch** – Key resources prioritized for optimal loading.  

#### **Hosting & CI/CD**  
- **Netlify** – Automated deployments via Git integration.  
  - Netlify Edge Functions for dynamic routing (if used).  
  - Atomic deploys and rollback capabilities.  
- **GitHub Actions** – Automated testing/linting (if configured).

### **2. Key Features & Innovations**  

#### **A. Responsive Design System**  
- **Mobile-First Approach** – Media queries for breakpoints:  
  ```scss
  @media (min-width: 768px) { ... } // Tablet  
  @media (min-width: 1024px) { ... } // Desktop  
  ```  
- **Fluid Typography** – `clamp()` for dynamic font scaling.  
- **Adaptive Images** – `<picture>` element with WebP fallbacks.  

#### **B. Interactive Components**  
- **Smooth Scroll Navigation** – Custom JS or CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth`.  
- **Hover & Focus States** – Micro-interactions for buttons, links, and cards.  
- **Dynamic Project Grid** – Filterable by category (e.g., "Web Dev", "Design").  

#### **C. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance)**  
- **ARIA Labels** – For screen readers (`aria-label`, `role` attributes).  
- **Keyboard Navigation** – Focus traps and `tabindex` management.  
- **Color Contrast** – Verified with tools like Axe or Lighthouse.  

#### **D. Analytics & SEO**  
- **Google Analytics 4** – Event tracking for user engagement.  
- **Meta Tags** – OpenGraph, Twitter Cards, and canonical URLs.  
- **Structured Data** – JSON-LD for `Person` schema (enhances search visibility).
